## 🧠 How It Works

- The program picks a **random number between 1 and 100**.
- You enter your guess.
- The game gives you hints:
  - **"Too high"** if your guess is too high.
  - **"Too low"** if your guess is too low.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number.
- It tells you how many attempts you took to guess the number.
